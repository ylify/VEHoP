# homology-phylogeny
A pipeline to construct a phylogenomic tree from genomic sequences

In most cases, phylogenetic relationships are based on amino acids sequences if multi-genes, but it is time-consuming and complicated step for researchers to predict eukaryotic genes from genome. The commonly used methods include MAKER and EVidenceModeler. Thanks to the newly published Protein-to-genome aligner by Dr. Heng Li, miniprot, it really benefit us to obtain the homolog-based prediction in few minutes. The other point is that Wellcome Sanger Institute is working on draw the genomic resources with thousands of organisms. Here, we develop a python-based pipeline, which could be used to construct a phylogenomic tree from genomic sequences.
