# Homolog-phylogeny
A pipeline to construct a phylogenomic tree from genomic sequences, transcripts, and proteins.

In most cases, phylogenetic relationships are based on amino acids sequences of multi-genes, but it is time-consuming and complicated for researchers to predict eukaryotic genes from the genome. The commonly used methods include MAKER and EVidenceModeler. Thanks to the newly published Protein-to-genome aligner by Dr. Heng Li, miniprot, it really benefits us to obtain the homolog-based prediction in a few minutes. The other point is that Wellcome Sanger Institute is working on expanding the genomic resources with thousands of organisms. In addition, the way to construct a good tree is somehow complicated, especially for the mushrooming data. Here, we develop a Python-based and one-step pipeline, which could be used to construct a phylogenomic tree from different sources, including genomic sequences, transcripts, and proteins.

Dependencies: miniprot, python3, CD-HIT, TransDecoder, OrthoFinder, FastTree, IQ-TREE2, Mafft, BMGE, HmmCleaner (optional), BioPerl, uniqHaplo, AlignmentCompare.


#Installation

##Pre-installation: mamba (highly suggested) or conda. Link: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge 

Command: mamba env create --name phylogenomics -f environment.yml (if mamba is not installed in your system, use conda)

##note: We integrate many software and packages into the pipeline. Of them, only HmmCleaner.pl could not be configured by conda/mamba. 

##Installation of HmmCleaner.pl: run two commands in HmmCleaner_install.sh (it might take ~20 minutes; be patientï¼›try HmmCleaner.pl to check whether it was executable.)

##As HmmCleaner.Pl is not a necessary one and the installation could be finished, I write it as the optional step in this pipeline. If such a file is not found or not executable in your system or environment, it will automatically skip. You don't have to do anything. 

##If you insist on installing it, please see the guidelines at https://metacpan.org/release/ARNODF/Bio-MUST-Apps-HmmCleaner-0.180750/source/INSTALL


#Usage: python3 homology-phylogeny.py prefix database (optional, needed if genomic files in raw) (with a folder "raw" containing genomic sequences)

Output: prefix.FastTree.full.tre, prefix.IQTREE2.full.tre
